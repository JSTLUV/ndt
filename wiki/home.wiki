== About ==

The Network Diagnostic Tool (*NDT*) is a client/server program that provides network configuration and performance testing to a user's computer.  The system is composed of a client program (command line or _Java_ applet) and a pair of server programs (a webserver and a testing/analysis engine).  Both command line and web-based clients communicate with a [http://www.web100.org/ Web100]-enhanced server to perform these diagnostic functions.  Multi-level results allow novice and expert users to view and understand the test results.

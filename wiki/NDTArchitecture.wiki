== Abstract ==

The Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) is a client/server program that provides network configuration and performance testing to a user's computer. The NDT consists of several modules responsible for various aspects of the [NDTTestMethodology test methodology]. This document identifies where in the overall codebase each of the high-level components reside to help with future development and maintenance. It also includes build instructions and documents the build and packaging process.

== Introduction ==

Only NDT Client and NDT Server are needed to perform all tests defined by the [NDTProtocol NDT Protocol]. However, the full NDT suite consists of the wide spectrum of tools that can be used for different purposes. We can specify three categories of the NDT components based on their areas of usage:
 * Client Tools
 * Server Tools
 * Administrative Tools

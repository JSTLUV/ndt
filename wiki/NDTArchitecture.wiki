#summary Description of the NDT architecture and life cycle

=NDT architecture and life cycle=

== Abstract ==

The Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) is a client/server program that provides network configuration and performance testing to a user's computer. The NDT consists of several modules responsible for various aspects of the [NDTTestMethodology test methodology]. This document identifies where in the overall codebase each of the high-level components reside to help with future development and maintenance. It also includes build instructions and documents the build and packaging process.

== Introduction ==

Only NDT Client and NDT Server are needed to perform all tests defined by the [NDTProtocol NDT Protocol]. However, the full NDT suite consists of the wide spectrum of tools that can be used for different purposes. We can specify three categories of the NDT components based on their areas of usage:
 * Client Tools
 * Server Tools
 * Administrative Tools

The NDT project is hosted on the [http://code.google.com/p/ndt Google Project Hosting] infrastructure. The latest project source code can be obtained anonymously over HTTP by using the following command:

{{{svn checkout http://ndt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ndt-read-only}}}

== Architecture Overview ==

The brief information about each of the NDT component can be found in the following table:

|| *Component Name* || *Type* || *Description* || *Sources Location* ||
|| *web100clt* || Client Tools || The NDT Client application. ||  ||
|| *Tcpbw100.jar* || Server/Client Tools || The Java Applet-based client that requires JVM browser plugin installed at the client machine. ||  ||
|| *web100srv* || Server Tools || The NDT Server application. ||  ||
|| fakewww || Server Tools || Optional 'lite' web server. ||  ||
|| analyze || Administrative Tools || Console based utility application that can look through the NDT log files and display the old test results. ||  ||
|| viewtrace || Administrative Tools || Console based utility application that can read [NDTDataFormat#tcpdump_trace tcpdump trace] files to perform packet pair timings to determine [NDTTestMethodology#Bottleneck_Link_Detection what type of bottleneck link exists] on the analyzed path. ||  ||
|| tr-mkmap || Administrative Tools || Console based utility application that can build a default traceroute tree between all federated NDT servers. The fakewww web server uses such pre-built traceroute trees to redirect clients to the closest NDT servers. ||  ||
|| genplot || Administrative Tools || Console based utility that can read [NDTDataFormat#web100_snaplog_trace web100 snaplog trace] files and generate xplot graphs from the obtained web100 variables. ||  ||
|| JAnalyze.jar || Administrative Tools || Java based utility application that can look through the NDT log files and display the old test results (along with displaying existing snaplog/tcpdump trace files and additional graphs). ||  ||
|| Admin.class || Administrative Tools || The Java Applet-based application that provides an administrator view of the NDT usage statistics (this applet is responsible for drawing the bar graph that appears on the admin view html page). ||  ||

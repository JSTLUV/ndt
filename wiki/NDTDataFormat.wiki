#summary Description of the data collected by NDT

=Data collected by the NDT= 

== Abstract == 

The Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) is a client/server program that provides network configuration and performance testing to a user's computer. The measured factors along with some additional analysis and detailed test traces are stored by the server for the future reuse. Moreover, multi-level results allow novice and expert users to view and understand the test results. This document describes what, where and when is stored by the NDT server. The information contained here should be enough to support parsing of the collected data for analysis and visualization purposes.

== Introduction ==

The NDT uses the following files to store the test results data:

|| *File* || *Scope of the collected data* || *Always used?* || *File extension* ||
|| *tcpdump trace* || C2S/S2C tests || *NO* (enabled by `-t, --tcpdump` options) || {{{*}}}.c2s_ndttrace / {{{*}}}.s2c_ndttrace ||
|| *web100 snaplog trace* || C2S/S2C tests || *NO* (enabled by `--snaplog` option) || {{{*}}}.c2s_snaplog / {{{*}}}.s2c_snaplog ||
|| *web100srv.log* || test session || YES || {{{*}}}.log ||
|| *cputime trace* || test session || *NO* (enabled by `--cputime` option) || {{{*}}}.cputime ||
|| *meta data file* || test session || YES || {{{*}}}.meta ||

The web100srv.log file is by default written under the `/usr/local/ndt/` directory. However, this can be changed by using the `-l, --log` options.

All other files are saved under the data directory (by default `/usr/local/ndt/serverdata/`) which can be set by using the `-L, --log_dir` options. To minimize the number of files in one directory, the test results are further grouped by the year, month and day the test was started in.

To sum up, the result files are saved in the following directories:

{{{
/DataDirPath/YYYY/MM/DD/
}}}

For example:

{{{
/usr/local/ndt/serverdata/2011/08/24/
}}}

The mentioned files are saved using the following filename format:

|| *ISOtime*{{{_}}}*serverFQDN*:*portNumber*.*extension* ||

where:
 * *ISOtime* - current time in the ISO format
 * *serverFQDN* - server host fully qualified name
 * *portNumber* - currently used port number (ephemeral ports for the snaplog and tcpdump traces, control session port for the cputime and meta files)
 * *extension* - extension used to distinguish file types

For example:

{{{
20110824T21:11:45.99598000Z_jeremian-laptop.local:33687.c2s_ndttrace
}}}

==Collected data formats==

===tcpdump trace===

Writing tcpdump trace files is enabled by the `-t, --tcpdump` options.

These are a standard trace files for all packets (except the initial syn & syn/ack exchange) sent during the individual C2S/S2C subtests (only the throughput tests' traffic is gathered that is sent on a newly created connection, all the NDT control protocol communication is not captured in these dump files).

The packets from the C2S Throughput test are stored in the {{{*}}}.c2s_ndttrace file, the packets from the S2C Throughput test are stored in the {{{*}}}.s2c_ndttrace file.

These tcpdump files are written using the [http://www.tcpdump.org/ pcap] library.

===web100 snaplog trace===

Writing snaplog file is enabled by `--snaplog` option.

This file contains all the [http://www.web100.org/ web100] kernel MIB variables' values written in a fixed time (default is 5 msec) increments. The list of logged variables with a short description can be found in the [NDTProtocol#Appendix_A._web100_variables NDT Protocol document].

===web100srv.log file===

The NDT always writes a one-line summary of the test to the web100srv.log file.

This one-line summary contains the final values of some of the web100 variables with an additional analysis details. The particular values are separated with commas without any spaces. The results are stored with the following order:

|| *#* || *Name* || *Description/Comment* ||

|| 48. || !AbruptTimeouts || (*{{{*}}}*) The number of timeouts that occurred without any immediately preceding duplicate acknowledgments or other indications of congestion. Abrupt Timeouts indicate that the path lost an entire window of data or acknowledgments. Timeouts that are preceded by duplicate acknowledgments or other congestion signals (e.g., ECN) are not counted as abrupt, and might have been avoided by a more sophisticated Fast Retransmit algorithm. ||
|| 49. || !SendStall || (*{{{*}}}*) The number of interface stalls or other sender local resource limitations that are treated as congestion signals. ||

==Displaying collected data==

The tcpdump files can be read using [http://www.tcpdump.org/ tcpdump] and [http://www.tcptrace.org/ tcptrace] programs.

The NDT package comes with a utility (called genplot) that can convert snaplog trace files into text or xplot graph files. Alternatively the user can write their own analysis program using the web100 library functions.

The NDT server also contains a Java application that can look through the NDT log files and link log entries to trace files, and it also simplifies the viewing of this data. The utility will need to be rewritten slightly to take advantage of the meta files instead of (in addition to) the log files.
 
The detailed tcpdump and snaplog files can be used to re-examine the test to see what happened, i.e.:
  * was there packet loss during the s2c test, and if so when/how often did it occur? 
  * what was the maximum throughput during TCP's slow-start growth phase? 
  * how many times did TCP oscillate in the Congestion Avoidance phase? 
  * did the test compete with other traffic? 
  * was there non-congestive loss on the path? 
  * was the test limited by the user's PC (default tunable settings)? 
  * how often did TCP retransmit packets, and were any of these unnecessary? 
  * were packets being reordered (e.g., sent 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 but received 1, 2, 4, 3, 5) 
  * what was the capacity of the bottleneck link in this path? 
  * did the test produce the expected results? 
  * was the client connected to a wired or wireless (!WiFi) network? 
  * is there a firewall and/or NAT box in the path?

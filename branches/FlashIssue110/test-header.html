This component was developed to test the reliablity and operational
status of your desktop computer and network connection.  It does this by sending data between your
computer and this remote NDT server.  These tests will determine:</font>
<ul>
 <li><font size=-1>The slowest link in the end-to-end path (Dial-up modem to 10 Gbps Ethernet/OC-192)</font>
 <li><font size=-1>The Ethernet duplex setting (full or half);</font>
 <li><font size=-1>If congestion is limiting end-to-end throughput.</font>
</ul>
<br><font size=-1>
It can also identify 2 serious error conditions:</font>
<ul>
 <li><font size=-1>Duplex Mismatch</font>
 <li><font size=-1>Excessive packet loss due to faulty cables.</font>
</ul>
<br>A test takes about 20 seconds.  Click on "start" to begin.
